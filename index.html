		<h2>Volunteer</h2>
        <p>As someone that experienced the &#8220;home computer&#8221; revolution as a child, I'm keen to help young people understand more about how technology works, and how that knowledge can help them in the future.</p>

		</ul>
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I enjoy most sports, but have always loved and followed cricket, having grown up around 200 metres from my local ground.</p>
        <ul>
			<li><strong>Cricket Umpire</strong> - I have umpired in the Warwickshire Cricket League for a number of years, and still enjoy playing in the occasional &#8220;friendly&#8221; game.</li>

			<li><strong>Technologist</strong> - I develop/maintain a number of small open-source projects, when I have time.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Family</h2>
