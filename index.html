		<h2>Volunteer</h2>
        <p>As someone that experienced the &#8220;home computer&#8221; revolution as a child, I'm keen to help young people understand more about how technology works, and how that knowledge can help them in the future.</p>
        <ul>
			<li><strong>Code Club Volunteer</strong> - I have successfully run code clubs at two schools in the Warwick area, introducing programming concepts to primary school children.</li>
			<li><strong>STEM Ambassador</strong> - I have attended a number of STEM events, with a focus on helping young people understand the possibilities of STEM-related hobbies &amp; businesses.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I enjoy most sports, but have always loved and followed cricket, having grown up around 200 metres from my local ground.</p>
        <ul>
			<li><strong>Cricket Umpire</strong> - I have umpired in the Warwickshire Cricket League for a number of years, and still enjoy playing in the occasional &#8220;friendly&#8221; game.</li>
			<li><strong>Hash House Harrier</strong> - I have run with various chapters of the Hash House Harriers club over the years, originally with <a href="https://www.sth3.org/">Sydney Thirsty</a> and most recently with <a href="https://www.warwickhash.org.uk/">Warwick</a></li>
